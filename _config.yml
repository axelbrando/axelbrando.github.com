      description: <p>Today, I am glad to announce I will be defending my Industrial PhD Dissertation.</p>![Cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PhDDefenseCover.png)<p></p><p>Abstract: Uncertainty is always around us. Every decision we take has an associated likelihood of success and decisions made by autonomous systems are not an exception. Despite the great advances in the field of artificial intelligence, the inability of these systems to identify a higher risk scenario a priori could prevent their inclusion as part of solutions to many real problems. This is why it is essential that these systems learn how to model and deal with uncertainty. Starting from a probabilistic approach, this thesis proposes to formalize the different types of uncertainty and, in particular, focus its research on one type of uncertainty, the aleatoric uncertainty, since it is detected as the main uncertainty for the financial real-world problem that motivates this doctorate. Based on such research, the thesis proposes new models to improve the state of the art in modeling such uncertainty as well as introduces a new real problem that appears when there is a fixed predictive system that does not model uncertainty and we want to model uncertainty a posteriori, without changing the original model. This problem will be denoted as the modeling of the uncertainty of a black box system and will motivate the proposal of new models specialized in maintaining the predictive advantages, such as Quantile Regression (QR), but for the black box problem. Subsequently, the QR research will motivate the proposal of new models to solve a QR literature problem known as the crossing quantile phenomena, which appears when different quantiles are predicted simultaneously and they do not preserve their correct order with respect to their quantile value. Finally, all of the above research will be summarized in visualization and evaluation methods for the predicted uncertainty to produce uncertainty-tailored methods.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>A first copy of the dissertation can be found here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1pVOkLg18d7pj9rKbtGESYbtADyT2U0VV">BrandoAxel_AleatoricUncertainty.pdf</a></p><p></p><p></p><p>Soon, we will: (1) Add the formal information to reference its content.
